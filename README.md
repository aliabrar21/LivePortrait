# LivePortrait Optimization Assignment

This repository contains the Google Colab notebook and related assets for the Machine Learning assignment provided by **IntellifAI Labs**. The objective was to analyze and optimize the inference performance of the [LivePortrait](https://github.com/facebookresearch/LivePortrait) repository.

## 📌 Assignment Objective

- Clone and run the original LivePortrait implementation.
- Measure and report the original inference time.
- Apply optimization techniques to improve performance.
- Measure and compare the optimized inference time.
- (Optional) Improve output quality and reduce GPU memory usage.

## 🧪 Results

### 🔹 Original Output

**Inference Time:** `X.XXXX` seconds

---

### 🔹 Optimized Output (Mixed Precision)

**Optimized Inference Time:** `Y.YYYY` seconds

## ⚙️ Optimization Techniques Applied

- **Mixed Precision Inference:** Used `torch.cuda.amp.autocast()` to reduce computation time and memory usage on GPU.
- **GPU Acceleration:** Ensured the model and data tensors run on CUDA.
- **Model in Eval Mode:** Applied `model.eval()` and `torch.no_grad()` to disable gradient computation.
- **Efficient Preprocessing:** Image preprocessing streamlined using `torchvision.transforms`.

## 📊 Performance Comparison

| Metric               | Original         | Optimized (Mixed Precision) |
|----------------------|------------------|------------------------------|
| Inference Time       | `X.XXXX` sec     | `Y.YYYY` sec                |
| GPU Memory Usage     | Higher (baseline)| Reduced (AMP enabled)       |
| Output Quality       | ✔ Baseline       | ✔ Comparable                |

## 💡 Future Improvements (Given More Time)

- Convert model to TorchScript or ONNX for faster deployment.
- Apply model pruning or quantization to reduce size.
- Use TensorRT for low-latency inference on edge devices.
- Parallelize frame-by-frame inference if used in video.

### ✅ Next Steps for You:

1. Replace:
   - `YOUR_NOTEBOOK_LINK_HERE` with your actual Google Colab notebook link.
   - Inference times `X.XXXX` and `Y.YYYY` with actual timings.
2. Ensure images (`original_output.png`, `optimized_output.png`) are inside a `screenshots/` folder in your GitHub repo.
3. Copy-paste the above Markdown into your `README.md` file in your repo.
